Preventing Sql Injection : - I have used parameterized query in each queries by that the attacker will not be able to manipulate sql queries.

Preventing Command Injection : - I have avoid using untrusted data which means whichever input is added by user is sanitized and validated and then only it is sent to the database

Cookie : - I have added secure and httponly functionality true for handling limited access to cookies
